# Diagnosis-from-ct-scans-deeplearning

In this project, we use deep learning principles to create a model that takes in ct-scan images as input to do diagnose respiratory diseases. The model accuracy is 86.5%.
The diseases diagnosed are:
1. Covid-19
2. Pneumoia
3. Squamous.cell.carcinoma
4. Large.cell.carcinoma
5. A normal person

# The desktop application
The model was deployed using a desktop application
